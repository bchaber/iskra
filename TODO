+ allow multiple species, sources
+ figure out diagnostics
+ wrap my head around np2c (where should I put it?)
/ optimize memory allocation (views and output arrays) -- made no difference
- implement boundary crossing
- warn when particle crosses more than one cell
- add histograms
- implement another solver (FiniteVolumeMethod? Boundary Element Method?)
- run some well-known tests, like two-stream instability
- store fields like ne-, nO+ with grid/cells
- implement chemical reactions
- implement cylindrical coordinate system (rz)
