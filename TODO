- bug in sample! when we need more particles than we can hold
- implement Null-Collision
- allow different timestep between collisions
+ check if paraview files can have time recorded to be displayed
+ implement MCC (elastic/ionization)
- implement DSMC
+ reaction rate should depend on E
+ variable spwt
+ negative density does not remove kinetic species
+ don't forget about np2c
+ allow multiple species, sources
+ figure out diagnostics
+ wrap my head around np2c (where should I put it?)
+ store fields like ne-, nO+ with grid/cells
+ implement chemical reactions
+ optimize memory allocation (views and output arrays) -- made no difference
- implement boundary crossing
- warn when particle crosses more than one cell
- add histograms
- run some well-known tests, like two-stream instability
- implement cylindrical coordinate system (rz)
- implement another solver (FiniteVolumeMethod? Boundary Element Method?)
