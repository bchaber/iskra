# iskra
A particle-in-cell simulator for spark simulations ("iskra" is the Polish word for spark).

# code
The code started as a loosely based version of Lubos Brieda's MATLAB code ES-PIC (https://www.particleincell.com/2011/particle-in-cell-example/).
Right now only 2D (XY) electrostatic simulations of collisionless plasma is possible, but it will change in the future.
